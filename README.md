Hi! 
Please take a look at guidelines and baselines for Cindicator Hybrid Intelligence contest on Dbrain platform.

For detailed data disambiguation please refer to ` 	DataExploration.ipynb` 


There are two baselines:

-`minimalistic` - predicts a constant, take a look to get familiar with Dbrain interfaces\
-`rf` - random forest on mean-based features, much more complex. Includes examples of dumping and loading a model and data preprocessing.

To understand how your model will be trained and how it will predict on Dbrain check out  `ModelTraining.ipynb`
